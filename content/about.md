## Whoami

Hey, I'm Halil also known online as **Oblivionsage**. Security researcher and final-year CS student based in Warsaw.

I spend most of my time hunting for memory-safety bugs, protocol flaws, and weird edge cases in real-world codebases. My usual workflow involves a mix of fuzzing, sanitizers, and manual reverse engineering.

## Work

I've reported vulnerabilities across different open-source projects and some of them have been assigned CVEs. I've also participated in a few bug bounty programs and earned some rewards along the way.

On the open-source side, I try to give back when I can — mostly through patches, security fixes, and small contributions to tools I use daily.

I've built a few personal tools over time, mainly for cryptographic analysis, binary reversing, and blockchain security research. Nothing fancy, just things that help me work faster.

## Currently

In my free time, I'm usually fuzzing something, reading disassembly, or writing about bugs I find when disclosure allows.
